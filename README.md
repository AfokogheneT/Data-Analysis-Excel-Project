Project Overview

This project explores customer behavior patterns for NY Citi Bikes. It aims to uncover insights into usage trends across age groups, locations, and customer types. 
The findings help guide decisions on bike placements and marketing strategies.


Sheet Description

The Excel sheet contains cleaned and summarized ride data, grouped by:

Age groups

Trip durations

User types (subscribers vs. one-time users)

Day of the week

Top pickup stations

Each sheet represents a key metric analyzed in the presentation.

How These Tools Were Used

Pivot tables summarize ride counts by age and user type.

Filters isolated specific user groups and dates.

Charts visualized trends, such as trip duration by age group.

Conditional formatting highlighted key figures.

Formulas (such as AVERAGE and COUNTIF) helped with analysis

Conclusion

The analysis revealed that most Citi Bike users are 35â€“44-year-old subscribers using bikes during weekdays, while one-time users are more active on weekends. 
The longest trips were taken by users aged 75+, though they rent the least. Data-driven recommendations were made for station expansions and targeted marketing.
